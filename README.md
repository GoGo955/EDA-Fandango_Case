https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/

## Overview
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

## Goal:
The goal is to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.

## Parts of project:
  1. Understanding the Background and Data.
  2. Exploring Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings.
  3. Comparison Other Sites.
  4. Fandago Scores vs. All Sites.

### The Data

This is the data behind the story [Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) openly available on 538's github: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data. There are two csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like Metacritic,IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes.
