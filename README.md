## Overview
If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?

## Goal:
The goal is to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.

## Parts of project:
  Understanding the Background and Data.
  Exploring Fandango Displayed Scores versus True User Ratings.
  Comparison Other Sites.
  Fandago Scores vs. All Sites.
